# To serif or not to serif, that's the question

This site uses a total of <span style="color: #ad6b00;">three</span> main fonts

* **PW Chalk** for the carved logo
* **Glass Antiqua** for headers
* **Didact Gothic** for everything else text

Having a good contrast between clear serif headers and smooth sans-serif 
body text gives distinction and looks very aesthetically pleasing

# Playing with depth and parallax

As you might have noticed, the squares in the background moves at different speeds as you scroll the page.
This technique is called '*parallax*' and is commonly used to give a feeling of depth in a picture (here's a good [explaination](https://www.sketch.com/blog/what-is-a-parallax-effect/))

The trick is to made is subtle enough so that it don't take away from the main attraction: the text content. The most common parallax implementations are often very hacky and has severe limitations. Hoping that the [*animation-timeline*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline) property gets widely adapted soon, as it would open up for a wide range of these effects!

# Guiding the users eyes

My goal for this website theme is for the user to read it like leaves in the wind, swaying back and forth until they finally reach the end of the page.
I believe it makes for a more fun and playful reading experience, which is what I'm trying to achieve here.

The font sizes, line heights and margins have been gratefully calculated by the site [gridlover.net](https://gridlover.net/). Honestly a fantastic time-saver, and the result feels very much like plug-n-play!

# Colours of nature and the joy of autumn

The colour palette of choice is inspired by the beauty of nature with the greens and the browns, but also the energetic and youthful feeling of orange.
These placeholder illustrations helps maintain the balance of the two as you're traversing the page, green being the main focus and orange being the aid.

Potraying emotions through colours can help convey a certain mood for the site for free without adding much else.
Accessibility and colour contrasts are still a challenge and a work in progress!
